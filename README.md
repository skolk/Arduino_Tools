# Arduino_Tools
A set of tools I've made for working with Arduino

Existing projects:
Arduino Timed Delay Pump
-Set the time to delay
-Set the amount of time to run
-Determine if you want the pump to reset (run again)

In Dev Projects
Arduino Serial I/O
I was tired or working with projects that more or less needed me to set a pin high or low (or read an analog)

so I made a serial read/write to set pins high and low without uploading code again

Proposed Projects
-Serial stepper commands for the Easy Stepper
